    "Admissions into UCLA are influenced by a number of factors, including a student's GPA and GRE scores. However, a student's prestige may also significantly influence the results of their application.

The model used gave us odds ratios of admission using the tier-2 prestigious schools and GPA were 0.02 and 2.18, respectively.
